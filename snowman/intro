 | This environment is based upon the state of your .cabal file at the time
 | when you entered the nix-shell. So if you change your .cabal file to modify
 | dependencies, you will need to exit, and re-enter the nix-shell to get an
 | environment that includes these changes.


   Tools included:
    * cabal
    * ghcid
    * stylish-haskell (if this is a GHC shell)

   You can add more tools to the shell by modifying the buildInputs in nix/base.nix
