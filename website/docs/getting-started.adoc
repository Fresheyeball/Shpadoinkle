Shpadoinkle is built with Nix, but you can build however you like. `stack` and `cabal` are supported with or without Nix.

== ‚õÑ Snowman

The fastest way to start a new Shpadoinkle project is to build a
{gitlab}/-/tree/master/snowman/[Snowman].
The following command will setup a new "hello world" project for you.

[source,bash]
----
bash <( curl https://gitlab.com/platonic/shpadoinkle/-/raw/master/snowman/generate.sh )
----

Once you have your new project you can get live reloads with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
nix-shell --run "ghcid --command 'cabal repl' -W -T Main.dev"
----

This will use `nix-shell` to setup a development environment for you, then execute `ghcid` inside the environment to watch your files, and execute `Main.dev` inside a repl. You can see results at `http://localhost:8080`. Of course you must have <<Nix>> installed for `nix-shell` to work.

[CAUTION]
Building from source can take a long time. If you run with `nix-build` it's highly recommended you use <<Cachix>>.

[NOTE]
.`chan`
If you are seeing version errors in your build, or getting something like _"attribute X not found"_, you may need to *update your channel*. You can manually set the field `chan` (line 4) in `nix/base.nix` to either a specific https://channels.nixos.org/[nix-channel version], or a specific hash (the latest hash building Shpadoinkle can be found https://gitlab.com/platonic/shpadoinkle/-/blob/master/nix/chan.nix[here]). Furthermore, you can control the channel for a build environment with the `--argstr chan` argument, for instance `nix-build --argstr chan "20.03"`.

== Nix

Nix works on all Linux distributions, as well as Darwin-based operating systems such as MacOS. To install Nix run:

[source,bash]
----
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
----

[WARNING]
.üëè Follow üëè Instructions
The install script outputs important instructions you need to follow. Read the output and follow instructions.

Success is indicated by the presence of the Nix toolchain in your terminal...

[source,bash]
----
nix --version
----

[NOTE]
.MacOS
Installing Nix on MacOS should work fine, but if you end up in a sticky situation, https://medium.com/@robinbb/install-nix-on-macos-catalina-ca8c03a225fc[this article may help.] You can also refer to https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sect-macos-installation[the official manual] for more information about Nix.

== Cachix

Some of the work done with Nix includes deviations from the official Nix package set. As such, some dependencies are not cached on https://cache.nixos.org. Building these dependencies from source can be very slow. If you would like to avoid this wait, you can pull from our https://cachix.org/[Cachix] cache of pre-built dependencies by executing the following:

[source,bash]
----
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
cachix use shpadoinkle
----

After executing the above, subsequent builds will use cached dependencies from https://shpadoinkle.cachix.org/[shpadoinkle.cachix.org], which are kept up to date with `master` using GitLab CI.
