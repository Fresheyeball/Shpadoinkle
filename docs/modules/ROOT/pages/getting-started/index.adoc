Shpadoinkle is built with Nix, but you can build however you like. `stack` and `cabal` are supported with or without Nix.

[TIP]

====
The fastest way to start a new Shpadoinkle project is to build a https://gitlab.com/fresheyeball/Shpadoinkle-snowman/-/tree/master#snowman[Snowman].
[source,bash]
----
bash <( curl https://gitlab.com/fresheyeball/Shpadoinkle-snowman/-/raw/master/generator.sh )

== Nix

Nix works on all Linux distributions, as well as Darwin-based operating systems such as MacOS. To install Nix run:

[source,bash]
----
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
----

[WARNING]
.👏 Follow 👏 Instructions
The install script outputs important instructions you need to follow. Read the output and follow instructions.

Success is indicated by the presence of the Nix toolchain in your terminal...

[source,bash]
----
nix --version
----

[NOTE]
.MacOS
Installing Nix on MacOS should work fine, but if you end up in a sticky situation, https://medium.com/@robinbb/install-nix-on-macos-catalina-ca8c03a225fc[this article may help.] You can also refer to https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/#sect-macos-installation[the official manual] for more information about Nix.


== Cachix

Some of the work done with Nix includes deviations from the official Nix package set. As such, some dependencies are not cached on https://cache.nixos.org. Building these dependencies from source can be very slow. If you would like to avoid this wait, you can pull from our https://cachix.org/[Cachix] cache of pre-built dependencies.

[source,bash]
----
nix-env -iA cachix -f https://cachix.org/api/v1/install
cachix use shpadoinkle
----

Now builds of Shpadoinkle will used cached dependencies from https://shpadoinkle.cachix.org/[shpadoinkle.cachix.org], which are kept up to date with `master` using GitLab CI.
