= Extend an example

The easiest way to try out Shpadoinkle is to extend one of the examples.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://gitlab.com/fresheyeball/Shpadoinkle.git
cd Shpadoinkle
----

== Building Examples

Shpadoinkle works with both https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc[GHC] and https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs[GHCjs].

=== GHCjs

When built with GHCjs, Shpadoinkle Haskell code is compiled to JavaScript. This is the recommended path for run code in production, for the majority of use-cases.

[source,bash]
----
nix-build --arg isJS true -A Shpadoinkle-examples
----

this will generate a folder called `result`. This contains the output of GHCjs. You can now serve an example. Here we use `warp` which is a static file server written in Haskell. However you can serve `result/bin/counter.jsexe` in any way you like.

[source,bash]
----
nix-shell -p haskellPackages.wai-app-static --command "warp -d result/bin/counter.jsexe -p 8080"
----

open `localhost:8080` in your browser.

=== GHC

When built with GHC, Shpadoinkle runs via https://hackage.haskell.org/package/jsaddle-warp[JSaddle Warp]. This allows frontend Haskell code to be compiled and executed as a backend binary. IO effects are sent to the browser over a websocket, where they are executed by a minimal client written in JavaScript.

[source,bash]
----
nix-build --arg isJS false -A Shpadoinkle-examples
----

this will generate a folder called `result`. This contains the output of GHC. You can now serve an example.

[source,bash]
----
./result/bin/counter
----

open `localhost:8080` in your browser.

== Live development

For live development building a fully optimized build from scratch with `nix-build` can be too slow. When writing code, we need rapid feedback to be productive.

=== GHCID

[quote, ndmitchell]
Either "GHCi as a daemon" or "GHC + a bit of an IDE". To a first approximation, it opens ghci and runs :reload whenever your source code changes, formatting the output to fit a fixed height console.

https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid[GHCID] is supplied by the `nix-shell` in Shpadoinkle. You can use GHCID to get rapid feedback as follows:

[source,bash]
----
nix-shell examples
ghcid --command "cabal repl examples:counter
----

you can also get this with a one liner

[source,bash]
----
nix-shell examples --command "ghcid --command 'cabal repl examples:counter'"
----

=== Repl Serving

The easiest way to get changes into your browser as fast as possible is to reload main in a repl.

[source,bash]
----
nix-shell examples
cabal repl examples:counter
----

You can then run the application with `main`. This will serve the application on `localhost:8080`. When you make changes to the code, simply press `[Ctrl+C]` then reload and run `main` once again.

[source,haskell]
----
:reload
main
----

Refresh your browser to view updates. Live reloading is also possible with JSaddle Warp, but has not yet been implimented.


=== Incremental Builds

Right now incremental builds only work with GHC.

[source,bash]
----
nix-shell examples
cabal build examples:counter
----

using `cabal build` directly will use the standard Haskell incremental builds. Results can be found in the `dist` folder as you would expect.
