https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CizU8aB3c8[Shpadoinkle] is a new way to
program user interfaces with Haskell.

To begin using it, go to 
xref:getting-started/index.adoc[Getting Started].


Fast::

Shpadoinkle is fast because it does little work. The renderer is modular, so
you can always benefit from the latest advances in virtual DOM rendering.

Declarative::

Your Shpadoinkle code is high-level. You need not worry about low-level
details, causality, or when DOM nodes get replaced.

Composable::

With Shpadoinkle, there is no need to associate model update code with DOM
locations. This avoids elaborate passing of messages and payloads. Components
are highly composable.

Reliable::

Shpadoinkle UIs are composed of components with no side-effects. So, runtime
errors are exceedingly rare. Code is easy to test because model updates are
pure functions.
