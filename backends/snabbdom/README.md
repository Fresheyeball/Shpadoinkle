This package contains a script to setup the [Snabbdom](https://github.com/snabbdom/snabbdom) virtual dom library as a backend to render Shpadoinkle applications.

> Snabbdom consists of an extremely simple, performant, and extensible core that is only â‰ˆ 200 SLOC. It offers a modular architecture with rich functionality for extensions through custom modules. To keep the core simple, all non-essential functionality is delegated to modules.

These design decisions made Snabbdom a good fit for Shpadoinkle's first high-performance pure JavaScript backend. Right now Snabbdom is being provided via [CloudFlare](https://cdnjs.com/) content delivery network (CDN) and is not included in this repo. This is great for getting started fast and having a transparent developer experience where you can simply switch to the backend of your choosing. However, this is not a stable long term approach as the CDN artifact could be removed at any time. If you wish to use Snabbdom in production, I recommend either:

- Proactively monitoring the CDN endpoints
- Wrap `SnabbdomT` in your own `newtype` and overriding the `setup` method in the `Backend` instance with a mechanism where you provide Snabbdom's JavaScript artifacts yourself.
